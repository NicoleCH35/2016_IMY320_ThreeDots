### Design Choices:
- Font: We chose to use a sans serif font as they are better on the web. http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2013/03/serif-vs-sans-the-final-battle/ It also matches our modern, minimal design style.
- Overal feel: Modern and minimal. This ensures a professional and clean looking website.
- Tiles: Each element sits in its own tile to ensure each element and its components can be easily distinguished from other elements.
- Hamburger menu: Contains navigation with extra information about specific pages. It also contains the login form as it is small and shouldnt require an entire page to itself.
